# Zomato-Case-Study
## Executive Summary:
Using Python and libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy, I pulled data from Zamato on various restraunts to create meaningful conclusions. After identifying that the correlation between these stocks was the highest in Microsoft and Amazon, I concluded that a few things are good to keep in mind:

  1. Stocks will move in the same direction 96% of the time
  2. Investing in both stocks is not efficient diversification
  3. Risk will be similar in both stocks

## Business Problem:

Making investments is essential for individual or group investments. Risk is always a factor in investing in the stock market. How can we find a way to reduce this risk and maximize profit?

## Methodology:

  1. Extracted, cleaned, and transformed the data from the source
  2. Create visualizations to get a deeper understanding
     
## Skills:

Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, and writing functions.

## Results & Business Recommendation:
Creating visualizations has helped to get a deeper understanding of how stocks move and to make meaningful decisions with these insights. The correlation between certain stocks like Microsoft and Amazon is higher than others and lower in others as you can see below.

1. To diversify and reduce risk I would recommend investing in stocks with lower correlation
2. Stay away from investing in the same two stocks with high correlation
