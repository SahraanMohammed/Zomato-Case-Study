# Zomato-Case-Study
## Executive Summary:
Using Python and libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Numpy, I pulled data from Zamato on various restaurants to create meaningful conclusions. After finding where the hottest spots are located for cuisines and identifying that taking online orders versus not taking online orders was crucial in the rating of the restaurants, I concluded that a few things are good to keep in mind:

  1. Restaurants that accept online orders generally have higher ratings
  2. Accepting online orders increases volume and customer retention rate 
  3. North Indian cuisines are among the most popular types of food 

## Business Problem:

Making investments is essential for restaurants trying to succeed in a competitive business. Convenience is key to restaurant success. How can we find a way to maximize restaurant profit and edge out competition?

## Methodology:

  1. Extracted, cleaned, and transformed the data from the source
  2. Create visualizations like bar graphs and heatmaps to get a deeper understanding
     
## Skills:

Python: Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, and writing functions.

## Results & Business Recommendation:
Creating visualizations has helped to understand better how restaurants rank top in ratings and gain success in their industry. Offering online ordering increases customer ratings and reviews as you can see in the rating of 3.7 and above.

1. To increase profit and customer retention I would offer online ordering
2. Offer some North Indian foods at your restaurant 
3. Stay in hot spot areas to attract a high volume of customers (HeatMap is located in Python Notebook [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/SahraanMohammed/Zomato-CaseStudy/blob/main/Geospatial%20Analysis%20Project%20%28Zomato%20Case-Study%29.ipynb)
